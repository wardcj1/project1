# project1

Basis of this project is that it is a Dinner, Movie, Dessert random generator.
We are using three different kinds of APIs, those APIs are; Google Maps, Yelp, and OMDB.
Think of a Slot machine in casinos!
Google Maps APIs is used to determined to where to have dinner and dessert,
Yelp API is used to find reviews on the Dinner and Dessert places,
and OMDB API is used to generate a movie to watch.

Project Title: DinnerMovieDessert

Project Description:

DinnerMovieDessert will provide users with recommendations for dinner, movie, and dessert. 

Users will enter the landing page and be instructed to enter and submit their name and location (zip code) via input fields. Once users click the submit button, the landing page will then show the options for dinner, movie, and dessert in three unique boxes. 

Recommendations for each box (dinner, movie, and dessert) will randomly generate, with the dinner and dessert boxes to generate based on the location fields entered by the user. Each box will then populate with its first round of randomly generated recommendation. 

Users will have the option to either “keep” or “re-spin” each of the recommendations. Boxes “re-spun” will continue to randomly generate new recommendations, while the boxes “kept” will stay the same. Users will have the option to “re-spin” until all boxes are “kept”. Once all boxes are “kept”, users will be presented with their optimal selections and can then click to external links from the API’s (dinner: Yelp API; movie: OMDB API; dessert: Yelp API) to purchase/view details. 

APIs to be Used:
